1. *UniversalInitializations.txt* contains all the universal initialization, i.e., initializations that are assigned with two and even more names in multiple projects (at least two).

2. *ValidProjectNum.txt* contains the corresponding number of projects where each project-specific universal initialization extensively occurs.

3. The value of parameter **ProjectNum** in our manuscript is 80, which means that only the most popular 25 universal initializations are included in the coarse-grained filter of **VarNamer**.
